Components of AutomationEdge
AutomationEdge Server
AutomationEdge Agent
AutomationEdge Process Studio:- Java based tool used to develope workflow.
Workflow and process are two entities use to design automated solution
workflow takes the data, process that data and saves the data to the target folder.
Stored as XML file with .psw extension. Steps are executed parallel. Workflow gets built using steps.
Process:- It is focused on high level control task such as executing workflow.Stored as XML file with .psp extension.
Process gets build using entries.

AutomationEdgeAgent
- An agent is a piece of software that works on behalf of the AutomationEdge Engine and execute workflows 
- An agent can be installed on physical or virtual machine.
 Each physical/virtual can have one agent.
- If in case in windows os if there are multiple users operating the same machine then each user can have one agent.
- Multiple agents can be registered to one server
- Agents provide scalability to AutomationEdge as Agents can be deployed on multiple machines and harness the processing power of several machine.
- Agent is java based software which include JRE.

****Steps to register AutomationEdge Agent
1. Do agent settings to include JRE with agent.
 Automation Edge Server UI>> Click on Agents>> Click on Agents Settings>> Edit>> on the Include JRE with Agent>> Save.
2.Download Agent
Automation Edge Server UI>> Click on Agents>> Click on Agents list>> currently there are no agents register>> Click on download agent>> select no proxy and platform as windows.
3.Run Aeagent application.
bin>>Run aeagent.exe file
4. Check the status of aeagent on AutomationEdge server UI.


AutomationEdge Server
- It is AI driven intelligent RPA server where we can deploy business process solutions i.e workflows. We can do it either on premieses and on cloud.
- We can access the server using UI by visiting the website https://t3.automationedge.com

AE Deployment:-
Publishing workflow on AE server
- Use process Studio publish option to directly publish new workflows to AE or
- Use process studio export option to update workflows on AE.
steps:- 1.Publish workflow on AE server
2. Configure the workflow on server
3. Assign the workflow to agent
4. Execute the wokflow from catalogue
5. Finally see the result of execution in request page.

<-------------------------1.Publish workflow on AE server------------------------>
Step1:- Select the main process from the project
1.Right click on the project to publish>> select edit project option>>select main process in the edit project window.>>click ok>>click ok.

Step 2.Right click on the project >> select publish>>select create>> enter password of server>>
Select Yes on Publish confirmation window>>workflow details window will appear>> enter the workflow details like name, description, category by default, version as 1 >> click on create button.

step 3. Once worklow is publish then next time if changes are made then update  it:- 
Right click on the project >> select publish>>select update>> enter password of server>>Select Yes on Publish confirmation window>>workflow details window will appear>> enter the workflow details like version as 2 >> click on update button.

<-----------------------
2. Configure the workflow on server
3. Assign the workflow to agent
4. Execute the wokflow from catalogue
5. Finally see the result of execution in request page.
------------------------->

<----------------------- Status of Agent------------------------>
1.Running:- Status is up and running and ready to execute the requests.
2.Stopped:- Agent is turn off/shutdown
3.Unknown:- Server is unable to reach agent
Agent goes in this state-
When server is not sure about state of agent due to abrupt shutdown or neytwork failure.
In this case stop the agent using stop icon present in actions column. once agent is stopped you can start the agent again.
4.Updating:- Agent, Workflow and Plugin related changes.
In this state, Agent goes in this state:-
  Older to newer version, workflow assignment, plugin assignment changes, workflow/plugin updated.

<--------------------------Workflow execution states---------------->
1.New:- Intial state in workflow execution. If new state continues for longer duration then need to check the status of Agent.
2.Execution started:-when agent picks up the request excution started.
3.Complete:- once the execution of workflow is completed the status occurs
4.Failure:- Once if the error occured while the execution the status changes to failure
If occured- Click on the plus to see the elaborated description. Then check the reason for failure and accordingly take the action. Failure workflow can be restarted.
5.Diverted
6.Terminated:- when manually terminated the status
7.Expired:- Expired status applies to the request when agent fails to pick up the request.
Expired workflow can't be restarted. You need to submit the request again
8.Awaiting Input:- when workflow requires manual intervations or input.
